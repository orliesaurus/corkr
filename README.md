Plugging the government's digital holes

#What is it?
----
During the Rewired State 2014 hackathon based on a true story by @edent we had the brilliant idea to create a quick and effective way to disclose the insecure state of .gov.uk websites.

We therefore created an interactive dashboard that lists what websites .gov.uk websites are insecure.  We list what vulnerabilities such websites are subject to, and then aggregate this information geographically.

Our aim is to raise awareness on web-security and the importance of maintaining websites, especially because these are government websites.
